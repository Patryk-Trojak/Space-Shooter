# Space Shooter
It is a simple 2D game created for an IT competition. We play with spaceship and destroy asteroids which appear on top of the screen and move to the bottom. We cannot let them go out of the screen. They cannot also destroy our spaceship. We have to survive as many waves as we can. Each successive wave is harder and harder.
